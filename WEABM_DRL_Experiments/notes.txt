Experiment 1 is observiing M1 genes seperately and acting only on {TGFb, TNF, IL10, HGF, cytotox}

Experiement 2 is observiing M1 genes combined (summed) and acting only on {TGFb, TNF, IL10, HGF, cytotox}



Experiment 4 is observing everything and acting on only {TGFb, TNF, IL10, HGF, cytotox}

Experiment 5 is observiing everything and acting on everything

experiment 6 is same as 2 but training for a week

experiment 7 is same as 2 for only 30 hours (didnt run on week and we lost the reservation- need to restart it)

experiment 8 is the normal sum M1 and act on subset

experiment 12 is sense M1 and act on everything

experiment 13 is same as 12

experiment 14 is observe everything and act on everything

^^^^ Experiments were on the no fibroblast version ofthe WEABM ^^^^ (i think)

experiment 15 is observe everything, act on everything

experiment 16 is observe everything, act on only TGFb, TNF, IL10, HGF and cytotox

experiment 17 is observe everything, act only on TNF, IL10, and IL4

experiment 18 is observe only M1, act on everything

experiment 19 is observe only M1, act on only TGFb, TNF, IL10, HGF and cytotox

experiment 20 is observe only M1, act on only TNF, IL10, and IL4



-----NEW WEABM VESRION-----


experiment 21 uses a new version of WEABM with full action/obs

experiment 22 is accudentally the same as 21 (forgot to change which env file to use)

experiment 23 is same as 21 (re-run due to mpi error cutting it short)

experiment 24 is limited action/observation

experiment 23/24 are because 21 and 22 ran out of memory necause of mpi stuff I think, so re-running as experiments 23/24

experiments 25/26 are same as 23/24 except using PPO instead of DDPG

-------------------------------------------------------------------
WEABM_interval_1 does not actually have any interval to it. it is full control the whole time. 
Observe NO(as sum of M1 genes) and TGFb, act on TGFb, TNF, IL10, HGF and cytotox

interval 2 is actual interval training with brand new model. Same obs/action as interval1, but 6 hours on,42 off

int3 = int1
int4=int2
int3_test is testing the non-interval trained model from int3 in an interval setting
